# Interactive-Music-Video-Experiment
Still in progress.

The website is currently capable of playing an original song and letting a user apply a low-pass filter, change the pitch, play sounds, and trigger different parts of the song.
There are graphics which move in time with the song and change colour based on the melody. Further optimizations needs to be made to improve the perfomance of the graphics to reduce lag. 


The audio functionality is written using the Web Audio API and the graphics is written using Three.js.
